# Latent Recurrent Depth LM

Welcome to the Latent Recurrent Depth LM repository.

## Overview
This project presents a novel approach that integrates latent representations with recurrent architectures for depth modeling. It is designed for efficient learning and inference in complex environments.

## Key Features
- **Latent Representations:** Captures essential features dynamically.
- **Recurrent Architecture:** Models sequential dependency to improve performance.
- **Depth Modeling:** Enhanced depth representation for various applications.
- **Scalability:** Easily adaptable and scalable for different use cases.

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the main script: `python main.py`

## Detailed Example
Below is an example of initializing the recurrent depth model in the codebase:

```python
from model import LatentRecurrentDepthModel

model = LatentRecurrentDepthModel(
    latent_dim=128,
    num_layers=3,
    depth_channels=64
)
output = model.forward(input_data)
```

## Usage
For detailed usage instructions, refer to the `docs` folder which covers configuration, training, and evaluation steps.
